# Snake game client

## All you have to do to play is run play.js!

Note: If you want to customize player messages, you can edit the "Say: \<message\>" <br> to be whatever you would prefer. Keep it PG!  

## Keybindings:
* Movement: WASD
* Sayings: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 (Each bound to something different)
* Quit: CTRL + C

You can customize only the quitkey in constants, peasants.
